# Research output

Use this order.

## Verdict

One line: preferred pool, conditional choice, reject, or not assessable.

## Bound identity

Chain ID, protocol version, pool address or PoolId, ordered token addresses, fee, tick spacing or invariant, hook, gauge, and observation block.

## Hard gates

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Identity | pass, fail, unknown | source and read |
| Tokens | pass, fail, unknown | transfer and control findings |
| Pool and hook | pass, fail, unknown | code and state findings |
| Yield | pass, fail, unknown | fees and incentives separated |
| Exit | pass, fail, unknown | quoted full unwind at size |

## Comparable economics

Use the same time windows and units. Show fees, incentives, costs, current depth, active-liquidity fit, and inventory risk. State what is measured, estimated, or unknown.

## Risks and invalidation

List the shortest set of facts that can cause material loss or reverse the choice. Name who controls each mutable parameter.

## Next action

State the one missing read or planning step. Do not include calldata or a wallet prompt.
