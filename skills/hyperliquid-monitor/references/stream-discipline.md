# Stream discipline

## State model

Treat a stream as `connecting`, `snapshot`, `live`, `gapped`, `reconciling`, or `stopped`. Only `live` data inside its freshness bound can produce `not-triggered`.

## Start

1. Record network, subscriptions, user address, DEX, and start time.
2. Fetch a REST snapshot for stateful subjects.
3. Subscribe and identify which first messages are snapshots.
4. Deduplicate by stable identifiers such as trade ID, order ID, client order ID, sequence, or timestamp plus payload identity.
5. Declare live only after snapshot and stream positions agree or their ordering is reconciled.

## Heartbeat and freshness

Send the documented ping and require a recent pong or data heartbeat. Enforce connection, subscription, message, and condition-evaluation freshness separately. A running process with an old last message is not healthy.

## Reconnect

On disconnect:

1. Enter `gapped` and stop clean-negative alerts.
2. Record the last confirmed event time and identifiers.
3. Reconnect and resubscribe.
4. Backfill the gap with REST history where available.
5. Deduplicate overlapping events.
6. Fetch current account and order snapshots.
7. Return to `live` only after reconciliation.

If the available history cannot cover the gap, report the interval as unknown.

## Event rules

- Do not treat the initial user-fills snapshot as new fills.
- Open candles update repeatedly; label intrabar evaluation or wait for close.
- Book updates need a fresh snapshot after a gap unless the feed supplies complete sequencing and replay.
- WebSocket acknowledgements prove subscription acceptance, not data freshness.
- Callbacks may alert or persist evidence. They must not invoke an exchange write.

Respect current connection, subscription, message, in-flight, IP, and address limits from the official rate-limit page. Back off on rate limits instead of increasing concurrency.
