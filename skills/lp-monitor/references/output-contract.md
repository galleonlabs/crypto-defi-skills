# Monitor output

## Verdict

One line: hold, collect, recenter, restake, reduce, exit, or state unknown. Include the condition that would change it.

## Bound position

Chain ID, wallet, protocol, pool, position ID or LP balance, staking state, token order, observation block, and evidence class.

## State

For concentrated positions show current tick, range, active state, distance to each edge, liquidity, claimable fees, and claimable rewards. For ordinary full-range positions show reserve share and gauge state. For hook-issued shares show all currencies, internal reserves, actual balances, share supply, attributable shares, rate sources, invariant controls, and proportional exit amounts.

## Accounting

Show original quantities or `unknown`, current inventory, HOLD value, claimable and realized income, loose residue, costs, divergence, and net result versus HOLD. Label every estimate and window.

## Action economics

Show full action cost, expected incremental benefit, break-even assumption, invalidation, and skipped gates. If no action clears the hurdle, say HOLD.

## Next read

State the next block, time, price, range, reward epoch, or security event that warrants another check. Do not include calldata.
