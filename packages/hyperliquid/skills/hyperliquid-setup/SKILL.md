# Hyperliquid setup

Take a new agent from installed instructions to a verified first read and a precise next step.

## Tool selection

When connecting or choosing tools, read [official tools](references/official-tools.md). Reuse a suitable maintained upstream capability before implementing new integration code; tool adoption stays optional and never supplies wallet authority.

## First task and connected workflow

Inventory real tool capabilities and complete one public market read without account credentials. Read [agent integration and handoffs](references/agent-integration.md) on first use or when a tool or related skill is missing.

## Workflow

1. Inventory the tools actually exposed by the harness: browser/HTTP, shell/Node, account reads, unsigned ticket building, signer submission, and reconciliation. Do not assume a named MCP server or wallet exists because a skill mentions it.
2. Read [connections and first-run procedure](references/connections.md). Select mainnet or testnet explicitly. Public market analysis needs no wallet or secret. Reuse the user's environment choice; ask only if it changes the task.
3. Run one public read for the exact requested market. From this skill's own directory, run `node scripts/market-snapshot.mjs --coin ETH --network mainnet`, substituting the requested market. Without a shell, use the two documented HTTP requests. Do not use a fixture as current evidence.
4. Validate network, coin, metadata precision, book freshness, and response coverage. Report mark/oracle price, spread, reported funding, observation time, and limitations. Missing data is unavailable, not zero. A successful public read establishes analysis access only.
5. Map requested workflows to [capabilities and handoffs](references/agent-integration.md). For account reads, request the public user/subaccount address; never substitute an API wallet address. For execution, require an existing trusted signer with the documented capabilities. Never handle secrets or approve an API wallet during setup.
6. Produce a readiness record: network, exact tool names, operations each tool supports, evidence, missing capabilities, available workflows, and one next action. Route to the appropriate installed skill; if absent, use the local handoff contract or offer its explicit installation command.

## Completion

The first read must have a dated result or an explicit diagnostic failure. Setup is complete when the agent can name what it can do now and what remains unavailable. It is not proof of a connected account, complete trading integration, or authority to act.
