# Liquidity custody and executable exits

## Discover enough of the market to support the claim

Record every discovery source, factory/version, searched block interval, pagination and exclusions. Separate the advertised pool from other material pools. Indexer results are a candidate set; verify identities and state with supported onchain reads. If historical indexing is unavailable, narrow the conclusion to observed pools rather than declaring there are no others.

For each position, trace beneficial ownership, manager, token/NFT identifier, approvals, operator, locker and any contract capable of decreasing liquidity, transferring the position, rescuing assets or upgrading those paths. State what is locked, for whom, under which code and for how long. Locked principal does not establish locked fees, price support or in-range liquidity.

## Uniswap version matters

For v3, verify factory/pool identity and token pair; read the manager's position, owner, approvals and tick range. Analyze principal and uncollected fees separately. Use [official position data](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/INonfungiblePositionManager.sol) and the matching deployment ABI.

For v4, identify the complete PoolKey and derived PoolId, selected PoolManager, hook and PositionManager. Read the exact pool/position state through the supported [pool-state interface](https://developers.uniswap.org/docs/protocols/v4/guides/read-pool-state). The [singleton](https://developers.uniswap.org/docs/protocols/v4/concepts/poolmanager) holds state for multiple pools; its total token balance is not one pool's reserve. Hook permissions and custom accounting can affect removal and swap outcomes. Do not assume the manager implements ERC721Enumerable; use documented [position discovery](https://developers.uniswap.org/docs/sdks/v4/guides/managing-liquidity/position-fetching) and reconcile indexed history with chain state.

## Show an exit curve at the requested size

Choose a small diagnostic amount and the user's relevant holding sizes; record amounts in exact base units and display units. For each quote, preserve pool/route, caller assumptions, chain state, quote asset, expected output, fee treatment and failure reason. Report per-unit degradation with size. Distinguish market price impact from chosen slippage tolerance and transaction cost. Do not label a price API response an executable quote.

A past successful sell proves only the historical caller, route and state. Check current transfer restrictions, exemptions, approval prerequisites and available depth. Quotes from privileged or exempt callers do not establish an ordinary holder's exit. A fork test must record its synthetic accounts, state overrides, transaction receipt, actual payout delta and remaining conversion costs; logs alone can mislead.

If the quote asset is a wrapper, bridge asset or tokenized claim, show the next conversion or redemption constraints. A sale into an unredeemable claim does not satisfy a request to exit into a liquid underlying asset. No live sell or approval is needed for this review.
