# Controls and economic dependencies

Map authority before ranking risks. For each material contract, retain address, chain, role, runtime identity, code/source correspondence, observation pin and how it relates to the target. Include the token, implementations, factory, fee/reward layer, treasury, locker, oracle and privileged callers that can change holder outcomes. Do not infer a deployed version from a website's current ABI.

## Capability and controller

Inspect the effective paths for issuance, balance changes, confiscation, transfer gating, buy/sell taxes, exemptions, freezes, arbitrary calls and delegatecall. Distinguish the rules active today from the authority to install different rules tomorrow. Record the actual controlling accounts or contracts, role administrators, multisig threshold and timelock delay/bypass paths. A renounced owner does not settle other roles or external controllers. Follow [OpenZeppelin's access-control model](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/access-control) as a reference, then verify the deployed implementation's behavior.

Resolve proxy implementation and beacon/admin state from the selected deployment. [ERC-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) defines common storage locations; empty slots do not rule out custom proxies, clones or other control mechanisms. Identical proxy runtimes can delegate to different logic and retain different state. Store those distinctions before reusing any analysis.

When source correspondence is uncertain, start with runtime, selectors, compiler metadata and available verified predecessors. Escalate to storage/history and narrow fork experiments only if needed to answer the question. Decompiler output remains a hypothesis until meaningful bytecode correspondence is established. Route broad exploit searches to a separately scoped protocol audit.

## What holders can actually claim

Identify the asset or right held and each conversion needed to reach the desired payout. Review eligibility, claim authority, collateral denomination, redemption queue/cap, fees, reserve availability and the administrator's ability to alter them. A treasury balance, synthetic reward or advertised buyback is not automatically a holder-enforceable claim. Trace any wrapper or quote asset to its own custody and exit dependencies.

For reward accounting, reconcile entitled, paid, unpaid and retained quantities by epoch and recipient. Check duplicate claims, caps, adjustments, prefunding and whether a stalled distributor can resume. Keep accounting solvency separate from processing liveness; both affect whether holders receive assets. Reuse the actual product's audited accounting model rather than assuming every vault follows ERC-4626.

Trigger deeper work when a material power, dependency or obligation remains unexplained. Stop once its executable scope and controller are evidenced or the missing evidence is explicit. Do not assign a clean result to an unreachable API or missing implementation.
